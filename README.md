# Prediction-in-time-series-dataset
The objective was to predict values of Para 9-13 for the 10th year of each section. I used an extra-trees regressor model by taking Para 1-8 and year as inputs in each section to perform regression upon this dataset.
## Extra-Trees Regressor
An extra tree is an algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by randomly selecting a subset of features and then training a Decision tree on them. The tree is then pruned only to contain the most important features for making predictions. The Extra tree algorithm is considered an efficient and accurate machine learning method. It has outperformed other popular methods such as support vector machines and random forests.
